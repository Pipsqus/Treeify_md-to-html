# Treeify. md to HTML
Convert your Markdown files to HTML, and create a webpage that links to all of them.

+ Place your files in the *markdown* folder
+ Run the *treeify.sh* script
+ Find all the converted files in the *html* folder. Every file will keep the original name, but have the .html extension. The page with all the links will have the title that you gave to the Treeify_md-to-html folder.
